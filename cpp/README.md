# OpenFront C++ Prototype

This directory contains a simple SDL-based prototype for a future C++ version of OpenFront.

## Building

Ensure you have `SDL2` and `CMake` installed, then run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The resulting executable `OpenFrontPrototype` will open a basic window as a starting point for further development.
